## ColdBox Manual - v5.0.0

ColdBox is a [conventions-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration) [HMVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–controller) development framework for [ColdFusion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_ColdFusion) \([CFML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ColdFusion_Markup_Language)\). It provides a set of reusable code and tools that can be used to increase your development productivity as well as a development standard for working in team environments.

ColdBox is natively based on [modular architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_design) which helps address most infrastructure concerns of typical web applications and thus called an HMVC framework.
